                <h5>Effective and Last Updated: 2019-06-01</h5>
                <p>The privacy of our visitors is important to us.</p>
                <p>This website, <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong>, is owned and operated by Truly Scaled Limited. We are
                    committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors while they interact with the content, products,
                    and services on this site (the “Site”). This Privacy Policy applies to the Site only. It does not
                    apply to other websites to which we link.</p>
                <p>Because we gather certain types of information about our users, we want you to understand what
                    information we collect about you, how we collect it, how that information is used, and how you can
                    control our disclosure of it. <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> may sell, rent, trade, or share your
                    personal information with third parties. You agree that your use of the Site signifies your assent
                    to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site.
                </p>
                <p>This privacy policy covers the following:</p>

                <h3>1) Information Collected</h3>
                <p>We collect two types of information from you: i) information that you voluntarily provide to us (e.g.
                    through a voluntary registration process, sign-ups or emails); and ii) information that is derived
                    through automated tracking mechanisms.</p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Voluntary Registration Information.</h3>
                        <p>In order to fully access this Site, you must first complete the registration process, during
                            which we will collect personal information about you. The information may include your name,
                            address, phone number, and email address. We do not collect personally identifiable
                            information about you except when you specifically provide such information to us on a
                            voluntary basis.</p>
                        <p>By registering with us, you consent to the use and method of disclosure as described in this
                            Privacy Policy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3>Voluntary Information for Services and Features</h3>
                        <p>We also collect personally identifiable information when you choose to use certain other
                            features of the Site, including: i) consenting to receive email, text messages, mailing, or
                            phone calls about upcoming promotions or events; ii) consenting to receive email; iii)
                            participating in reviews and discussions; iv) submitting questions via email, text, phone,
                            or any other communication medium. When you choose to use these additional features, we may
                            require you to provide your “Contact Information” in addition to other personal information,
                            such as your phone number, that may be required to complete a transaction. Occasionally, we
                            may also request information such as your shopping preferences and demographics which will
                            help us better serve you and our others users in the future.</p>

                        <h3>Log Files</h3>
                        <p>As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The
                            information in the log files include your IP (internet protocol) address, your ISP (internet
                            service provider, such as AOL or Shaw Cable), the browser you used to visit our site (such
                            as Google Chrome, Internet Explorer or Mozilla Firefox), the time you visited our site, and
                            which pages you visited throughout our site.</p>

                        <h3>Cookies</h3>
                        <p>We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our
                            site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to
                            login to some of our features, such as forums.</p>

                        <h4><em>How We Use Cookies</em></h4>
                        <p>Like many websites we use cookies to store and then retrieve small bits of information on
                            your computer when you visit. This information is used to make the site work as you expect
                            it to. It is not personally identifiable to you, but it can be used to give you a more
                            personalized web experience.</p>
                        <p>Some of the information stored is put there by other companies whose software we have added
                            to the site, and this can also impact your experience of other websites you may visit after
                            leaving ours. If you continue to use this site without taking action to prevent the storage
                            of this information, you are effectively agreeing to this use.</p>
                        <p>If you want to learn more about the general uses of cookies, including how to stop them being
                            stored by your computer, please visit <a href="http://cookiepedia.co.uk/all-about-cookies"

                                <p>These cookies may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be
                                    used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant
                                    adverts on other sites.</p>
                                <p>They do not store any personally identifiable information, but are based on uniquely
                                    identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow these cookies, you
                                    will experience less targeted advertising.</p>

                                <p>We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which
                                    places a cookie on your computer when you visit a site using DoubleClick
                                    advertising<em> (</em>including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is
                                    used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”).
                                </p>
                                <p>The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example,
                                    if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel
                                    advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey).
                                    DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal
                                    information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone
                                    number, social security numbers, bank account numbers, or credit card numbers.</p>

                            However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other

                <p>You may choose to invite friends to join the <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> by sending invitation
                    emails via our invite feature. <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> stores the email addresses you
                    provide so that the respondents may be added to your social network, and also to send reminders of
                    the invitations. <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> does not sell these email addresses or use them to
                    send any other communication besides invitations and invitation reminders. Recipients of invitations
                    may contact <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> to request removal of their information from our

                    legal action against someone who may be violating our terms and conditions of use or may be causing
                    injury or interference with our rights, property, our customers, or anyone who could be harmed by

                    SUBMIT IN REVIEWS, DISCUSSIONS, OR ANY OTHER PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE AREA OF THE SITE.</p>
                <p>You will receive notice when your personally identifiable information might be provided to any third
                    party for any reason other than as set forth in this Privacy Policy, and you will have an

                    data that contains no personally identifiable information.</p>

                <h3>4) How We Protect Your Information</h3>
                <p>We are committed to protecting the information we receive from you. We take appropriate security
                    measures to protect your information against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration,
                    disclosure, or destruction of data. To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and
                    ensure the correct use of information, we maintain appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial
                    procedures to safeguard and secure the information and data stored on our system. While no computer
                    system is completely secure, we believe the measures we have implemented reduce the likelihood of
                    security problems to a level appropriate to the type of data involved.</p>
                <p>We may sell, distribute or lease your personal information to third parties. We may use your personal
                    information to send you promotional information about third parties which we think you may find
                    interesting.</p>
                <p>If you believe that any information we have on you is incorrect or incomplete, please <a
                        href="mailto:accounts@trulyscaled.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern">contact us</a> as soon as possible, at the above address. We will promptly correct any
                    information found to be erroneous.</p>

                <h3>5)Third Party Advertising</h3>
                <p>Advertisements appearing on this Site may be delivered to you by <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> or
                    one of our Web advertising partners. Our Web advertising partners may set cookies. Doing this allows
                    the advertising partners to recognize your computer each time they send you an advertisement. In
                    this way, they may compile information about where you, or others who are using your computer, saw
                    their advertisements and determine which advertisements are clicked. This information allows an
                    advertising partner to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to
                    you. <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> does not have access to or control of the cookies that may be
                    placed by the third party advertising servers of ad partners.</p>
                <p>This privacy statement covers the use of cookies by <strong>Trulyscaled.com</strong> and may not
                    cover the use of cookies by any of its advertisers.</p>

                <h3>6) Accessing and Updating Your Personal Information and Preferences</h3>
                <p>We may provide mechanisms for updating and correcting your personal information for many of our
                    services. You may modify or remove any of your personal information by <a href="mailto:accounts@trulyscaled.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern">electronically
                        notifying us</a> of any changes.</p>
                <p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active, or as needed in order to
                    provide you services. Please <a href="mailto:accounts@trulyscaled.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern">contact us</a> if you wish to cancel your account or
                    request that we no longer use your information to provide you services. We will retain and use your
                    information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
                    agreements.</p>

                <h3>7) Email Choice/Opt-out</h3>
                <p>If you no longer wish to receive updates or notifications via our newsletter or other promotional
                    communications, you may opt-out of receiving these communications by selecting the appropriate
                    action link at the bottom of each email newsletter.</p>
                <p>If no such link is accessible to you and you would prefer not to receive such communications in the
                    future, you may <a href="mailto:accounts@trulyscaled.com?Subject=Privacy%20Policy%20Concern">electronically notify us</a> of any changes in your opt-in and/or
                    opt-out preferences.</p>
                <p>We will make commercially reasonable efforts to implement your opt-out requests promptly, but you may
                    still receive communications from us for up to ten (10) business days as we process your request.
                </p>
                <p>You may be notified if your personal information is collected by any third party that is not our
                    agent/service provider other than as specified in this policy, so you can make an informed choice as
                    to whether or not to share your information with that party. Although there are no plans to do this
                    presently, if this ever occurs, an opt-out will be provided to you before any personal information
                    is shared, so it is always your choice when information is provided to a third party.</p>

                <h3>8) Children’s Privacy and Parental Controls</h3>
                <p>We do not solicit any personal information from children. If you are not 18 or older, you are not
                    authorized to use the Site. Parents should be aware that there are parental control tools available
                    online that can be used to prevent children from submitting information online without parental
                    permission or from accessing material that is harmful to minors.</p>

                <h3>9) Links to other websites</h3>
                <p>Our website may contain links to other websites of interest. However, once you have used these links
                    to leave our site, you should note that we do not have any control over such external websites.
                    Therefore, we cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which you
                    provide whilst visiting such sites, and such sites are not governed by this privacy statement. You
                    should exercise caution and look at the privacy statement applicable to the website in question.</p>

                    or disclosure, we have put in place suitable physical, electronic and managerial procedures to
                    safeguard and secure the information we collect online.</p>
                <p>We may follow generally accepted standards to protect the personal information submitted to us, both
                    during transmission and once we receive it. No method of transmission over the Internet, or method
                    of electronic storage, is 100% secure, however. Therefore, we cannot guarantee its absolute
                    security.</p>
